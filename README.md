# ☀️ Solar Car Race Crew Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard built to support the **University of Michigan Solar Car Team** during the **2024 American Solar Challenge (ASC)**. The dashboard consolidates real-time race data into an intuitive web interface for efficient decision-making by the race crew.

## 🏁 Project Overview

### Objective
Provide an operational interface that enables the solar car race crew to:
- Monitor live telemetry data
- Track vehicle speed, energy use, and environmental conditions
- View team communications and geolocation
- Access historical and real-time race insights

### Motivation
During long-distance solar races like the ASC, success depends on rapid access to accurate data. This dashboard helped streamline operations by integrating critical systems into a single visual interface for strategy, safety, and performance optimization.

## 🔧 Features

- **Speed and Time Tracking**  
  Real-time vehicle speed and duration updates

- **Environmental Monitoring**  
  Displays current wind speed and temperature, crucial for energy management

- **Energy Panel**  
  Tracks solar and battery energy input/output

- **Live Location Map**  
  Pinpoints the car's GPS location on an interactive map

- **Live Chat Module**  
  Displays crew communications and command messages in real time

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python (Django)  
- **Database:** SQLite (used for prototyping; scalable to PostgreSQL)  
- **Deployment:** Local test server (expandable to AWS or embedded devices)

## 📈 Outcome

- Successfully supported the race crew during the 2024 ASC Championship
- Enabled real-time decision making with a clear and unified interface
- Demonstrated system reliability and extensibility for future races

## 💡 Key Takeaways
